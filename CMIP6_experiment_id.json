The spin up simulations may be made with the classic online or offline approach, or with tracer-acceleration techniques or fast solvers. If an online approach is used, at the end of the 6th cycle of the JRA55-do forcing, the model's physical fields should be reinitialized to the values at the start of the 4th cycle in order to avoid long-term drift in those fields and to assure that they will not diverge greatly from physical fields in the omip2 simulation. The spin up also includes radiocarbon to evaluate deep-ocean circulation",
