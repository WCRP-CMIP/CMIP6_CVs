# CMIP6_CVs [![stable version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Current%20version-6.2.58.74-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs/releases/tag/6.2.58.74) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/62754800.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12197150)

Core Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) for use in CMIP6

## Registering Institutions, Models, or requesting changes to CVs:

To register your institution or model or to register a new experiment, please submit an issue/ticket following the instructions on the [CMIP6_CVs issue page](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs/issues/new). Follow the same procedure to request a change in any other CV.

Some support for CMIP participating modeling groups is available: pcmdi-cmip@llnl.gov

The CVs build on logic that is described in the [CMIP6 Global Attributes, DRS, Filenames, Directory Structure, and CV's](http://goo.gl/v1drZl) document.

The controlled vocabularies for CMIP6 will be augmented (e.g., as new institutions, models and experiments are registered), but there should be no changes in the existing vocabulary that would impair searches of and access to already published data or that would in any way invalidate published data.
